# 🧠 Kaiburr Task 5  
### Text Classification of Consumer Complaints using Machine Learning  

---

## 📋 Project Overview  

This project is developed as part of the **Kaiburr Assessment - Task 5**.  
The goal is to build a **text classification model** that automatically categorizes consumer complaints into relevant financial product categories using machine learning techniques.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used  

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)  
- Joblib (for model saving/loading)  

---

## 🧾 Dataset  

The dataset used is the **Consumer Complaints Database** provided by the **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**.  

📂 **Dataset Source:**  
[Download complaints.csv.zip](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/ccdb/complaints.csv.zip)

⚠️ **Note:**  
The full dataset is too large to upload to GitHub (>100 MB).  
A smaller version named **`complaints_sample.csv`** (first 30000 rows) is included in this repository for demonstration and testing purposes.

---


## 🧹 Data Preprocessing  

- Removed non-alphabetic characters and converted all text to lowercase.  
- Lemmatized words using `WordNetLemmatizer`.  
- Combined similar categories (e.g., “Credit card or prepaid card” → “Credit card”).  
- Removed rare product classes (with fewer than 2 samples).  
- Split the dataset into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.

## 🧠 Model Architecture  

- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF Vectorizer (`max_features=7000`, `ngram_range=(1,2)`)  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression (`solver='liblinear'`, `class_weight='balanced'`)  
- **Training Epochs:** Adjustable via command line argument
